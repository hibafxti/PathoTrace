# PathoTrace

PathoTrace is a microbial inference engine built from scratch by a med student while studying for Step 1.  

It matches partial trait data to likely bacterial identities using structured logic.

This project is part of a larger exploration into how clinical reasoning can be codified, stress-tested, and made aesthetic.
